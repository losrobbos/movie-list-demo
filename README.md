# List CRUD

In this sample we wanna convert a hardcoded DOM list into a web app.

We do this with the following steps:

- Step 1: Outsource hardcoded list data into an array of objects
- Step 2: Generate DOM List dynamically
- Step 3: Create event listeners for changing the data in the array
- Step 3: Transfer all data changes to the DOM

And finally we will have converted this hardcoded UI into a dynamic, data-driven UI. 

Now we could more easily integrate an API to store & update our magical data at a central place out there in the web.
